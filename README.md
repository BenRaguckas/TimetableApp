# Keeping this as refference and notes

Working on UI implementation. Basic skeleton of a form is present but needs to be reworked into its own classes for easier maintenance. This is great example:

Looking into default value for dropdown. Cant confirm but this could be answer:

##  Plan
Need to populate all the dropdowns (may need to exlude 1 or two).
Tidy up leftovers from dropdown_search and form work.
Need to add form submission. Need to add validation too (confirm that a subject is selected at least).
Need to create a new "view" for displaying the timetable. For a placeholder a simple text display + debug will work.

May need to return and update styling to be more convenient.

Implement an options menu for setting favorite subject for easy search.
Implement a save for actual timetable display.
Implement some crude "editing". Likely with a comparison available.


Maybe consider implementing some testing.
