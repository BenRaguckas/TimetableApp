# Flutter app to streamline timetable viewing

This is primary driven by overwhelimgly tedious steps needed to view timetable from: timetable.ait.ie

Due to its underlying functionality based on Scientia Ltd - 2.1.0 this app could work with other timetables with minimal adjustment needed (theoretically).

There is no current plan to implement testing but I will revise this idea once all the desired functionality is in place and working as expected.
