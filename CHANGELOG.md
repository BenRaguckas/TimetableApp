# Basic log for all changes pushed
*Going to track most of changes that are pushed here.*

## 0.1
**First point of refference for progression**
Updated README.md + implemented this CHANGELOG.md

Implemented a basic Form with searchable dropdowns for selecting desired subject.
> Subject selections functions favorite (hardcoded placeholder atm)
> All other options are auto selected to their first value (same as web)
> Submit pushes a new widget that prints details of subject
*Currently it only works on default options and is untested for any others.*
*With functionality priority most of items are rudimentary*

### Plan for next
Tidy up some of the code for easier work
Get rid of redudant imports, etc.
Adjust the timetable display window to be more "easy to use".
Work on options menu as well as saving of TimeTable object.
